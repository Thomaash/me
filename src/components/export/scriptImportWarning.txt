<p>
	Imported project won't contain node positions (nodes will be placed automatically when you open the canvas), labels and a few other things (they're not present in the script).
	Most data (like nodes, ports, links, hostnames, IPs, other settingsâ€¦) will be imported just fine.

	This function is intended only for scripts generated by <strong>Mininet Editor</strong> or <strong>MiniEdit</strong>.
	Importing a custom script is possible but highly unreliable.
	Such project may be incomplete or dysfunctional.
